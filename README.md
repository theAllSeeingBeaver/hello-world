# hello-world
My firstest gitHub thingy!

Hello everyboddyydyaslklkjfg.kjg.... Sorry, my kitty cat be all up on my keyboard.

As I was saying, I'm very excited to start sharing ideas and developing software with all you fine folks!

I'm a newbie to data science and gui creation with a solid foundation in python 3.

...Teach me! I will accept all criticisms (especially those that employ a dash of wit) no matter how scathing or crushing they may be to my self-esteem. 

In closing, my legs hurt.
